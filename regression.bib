  abstract =      {Background: It is well known that the time from
                   conception to early childhood has importance for
                   health conditions that reach into later stages of
                   life. Recent research supports this view, and
                   diseases such as cardiovascular morbidity, cancer,
                   mental illnesses, asthma, and allergy may all have
                   component causes that act early in life. Exposures in
                   this period, which infl uence fetal growth, cell
                   divisions, and organ functioning, may have
                   long-lasting impact on health and disease
                   susceptibility. Methods: To investigate these issues
                   the Danish National Birth Cohort (Better health for
                   mother and child) was established. A large cohort of
                   pregnant women with long-term follow-up of the
                   offspring was the obvious choice because many of the
                   exposures of interest cannot be reconstructed with
                   sufficient validity back in time. The study needs to
                   be large, and it is aimed to recruit 100,000 women
                   early in pregnancy, and to continue follow-up for
                   decades. The Nordic countries are better suited for
                   this kind of research than most other countries
                   because of their population-based registers on
                   diseases, demography and social conditions, linkable
                   at the individual level by means of the unique
                   ID-number given to all citizens. Exposure information
                   is mainly collected by computer-assisted telephone
                   interviews with the women twice during pregnancy and
                   when their children are six and 18 months old.
                   Participants are also asked to fill in a
                   self-administered food frequency questionnaire in
                   mid-pregnancy. Furthermore, a biological bank has
                   been set up with blood taken from the mother twice
                   during pregnancy and blood from the umbilical cord
                   taken shortly after birth. Data collection started in
                   1996 and the project covered all regions in Denmark
                   in 1999. By August 2000, a total of 60,000 pregnant
                   women had been recruited to the study. It is expected
                   that a large number of gene-environmental hypotheses
                   need to be based on case-control analyses within a
                   cohort like this.},

  abstract =      {Birthweight is one of the most accessible and most
                   misunderstood variables in epidemiology. A baby's
                   weight at birth is strongly associated with mortality
                   risk during the first year and, to a lesser degree,
                   with developmental problems in childhood and the risk
                   of various diseases in adulthood. Epidemiological
                   analyses often regard birthweight as on the causal
                   pathway to these health outcomes. Under this
                   assumption of causality, birthweight is used to
                   explain variations in infant mortality and later
                   morbidity, and is also used as an intermediate health
                   endpoint in itself. Evidence presented here suggests
                   the link between birthweight and health outcomes may
                   not be causal. Methods of analysis that assume
                   causality are unreliable at best, and biased at
                   worst. The category of `low birthweight' in
                   particular is uninformative and seldom justified. The
                   main utility of the birthweight distribution is to
                   provide an estimate of the proportion of small
                   preterm births in a population (although even this
                   requires special analytical methods). While the
                   ordinary approaches to birthweight are not well
                   grounded, the links between birthweight and a range
                   of health outcomes may nonetheless reflect the
                   workings of biological mechanisms with implications
                   for human health.},
